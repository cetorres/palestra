Palestra
========

Lectures helper web mobile application.
I've developed this app to help me on my lectures at universities and events.
It allows the spectators to better interact with me throught:

1. On line presentation (using Slideshare) to follow
2. Twitter conversation during the lecture, using special hashtag
3. Lecture evaluatation feedback, allowing spectators to vote on many aspects of the presentation
